the zen of python by tim peters
beautiful is better than ugly 
explicit is better than implicit 
simple is better than complex 
complex is better than complicated 
flat is better than nested 
sparse is better than dense 
readability counts 
special cases are not special enough to break the rules 
although practicality beats purity 
errors should never pass silently 
unless explicitly silenced 
in the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess 
there should be one -- and preferably only one -- obvious way to do it 
although that way may not be obvious at first unless you are dutch 
now is better than never 
although never is often better than * right * now 
if the implementation is hard to explain , it is a bad idea 
if the implementation is easy to explain , it may be a good idea 
namespaces are one honking great idea -- let us do more of those !
